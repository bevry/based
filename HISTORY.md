## v1.18.0 2018 August 19

Edition engines are now the range of unique supported versions for that edition, and are trimmed and passed accordingly.

For instance, say `edition:esnext` supports node `6, 8, 10`.
However all the other editions only support node `0.10, 0.12, 4`.
Then you don't want those other editions, to run on node [6, 8, 10] via an engine of `>0.10`.
As such, targetted editions now have their engines set to the specific versions they support.
So for this example, `edition:node:0.8` would have the engines `0.10 || 0.12 || 4` instead of `>0.10`.

This can be seen from the following log output:
